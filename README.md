# Hangman Game in C++ with C# Integration

  This project is a simple Hangman game implemented in C++. The game word is passed from C# to the C++ game.
  
  Enjoy guessing the hidden word! :)
  
# Whats it about?

  This is a C++ / C# project that gets the game word generated through C# and then gets passed on to C++ for the actual game. This is a fun project built to       implement the knowledge gained in the COMP-2315 "Structured Programming" course. This includes using array manipulation, functions, loops and the task of  passing on a variable through a DLL connection.
